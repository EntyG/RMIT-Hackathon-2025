The game is designed to be fun, educational, and impactful, giving players a direct, interactive experience with the real-world challenges faced by communities on the front lines of climate change.

## üìñ Gameplay Guide

### Objective

Your goal is to reach the **target Treasury amount** by the end of **Year 20**.

### The Plants

Each plant has unique strengths and weaknesses. Choose wisely!

| Plant               | Cost    | Health | Production/Year | Special Notes                                     |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **üåæ Rice Paddy**   | 100 VND | 100    | 200 VND         | A reliable and sturdy source of income.           |
| **üçé Fruit Orchard**| 200 VND | 50     | 500 VND         | Extremely profitable but very fragile.            |
| **üå≥ Mangrove**     | 150 VND | 150    | 0 VND           | Produces no income but is your key to survival. |

### The Threat: Salinity

-   **Damage:** Each year, your crops take damage based on the global Salinity level. Their income is proportional to their remaining health. If health reaches 0, the plant is destroyed.
-   **Protection:** Mangroves are **immune** to Salinity damage. Furthermore, they protect all tiles (including other plants) in a **3x3 square** around themselves, cutting Salinity damage in half for those tiles.

### Yearly Events

At the start of each year, a random event will occur. These can include:
-   **Positive Events:** Government subsidies, bountiful harvests.
-   **Negative Events:** Floods that damage crops in a specific region.
-   **Dangerous Events:** Pests or ocean acidification that can damage even your mighty mangroves!

## ü§ñ Vibe Coding: The Role of AI in Development

This project was built following the "vibe coding" philosophy, leveraging various AI models to accelerate development, generate content, and create assets.

### üí° Game Design & Content (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

-   **Initial Concept:** Brainstormed core mechanics for a game about climate change in the Mekong Delta.
-   **Event Generation:** AI was prompted to create a list of positive and negative event ideas, complete with descriptions and gameplay effects (e.g., `Give me 10 event ideas for a climate change game, with effects like 'salinity +8' or 'treasury +300'`).
-   **Instructional Text:** The text for the in-game "How to Play" guide was drafted and refined with AI assistance.

### üíª Code Generation (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

-   **Boilerplate HTML/CSS:** Initial layouts for the game board and dashboard were generated via prompts like `Write HTML and CSS for a 5x5 grid next to a stats panel using Flexbox`.
-   **JavaScript Logic:** AI helped scaffold complex functions, including:
    -   The main `endTurn()` game loop.
    -   The `renderBoard()` function for displaying tiles.
    -   Utility functions for damage calculation and checking for game-over conditions.

### üé® Asset Generation (Nano Banana)

All visual assets in the game were generated using AI image models.

-   **Background Art:** `Digital painting, beautiful landscape of the Mekong Delta, game background art`
-   **Plant Sprites:** `pixel art game asset, a lush green rice paddy tile, top-down view, simple, 2D sprite`
-   **Favicon:** `pixel art favicon, a simple mangrove tree, 32x32, vibrant green`
